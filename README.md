## What is this?

This is a simple example of making a typical web app with TerminusDB. This
example implements [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) with
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev), and then uses TerminusDB to store the Todo list.

Please [install TerminusDB](https://terminusdb.com/hub/download) and have it
running. TerminusDB just needs to be running, you will not be using the console
right now, so you can just minimize it.

Once TerminusDB is running, add the DB and Schema.

``` bash
$ npm run initdb

> svelte-app@1.0.0 initdb /home/dk/Work/TerminusDB/terminusdb-todoapp
> node util/initdb.js

# checking db
# creating db
# checking schema
# creating schema
# add todo1
# add todo2
# done
```

Now npm install and run the app.

``` bash
$ npm install && npm run dev

[...miles of scrolling console spew...]

 Your application is ready~! ðŸš€

  - Local:      http://localhost:5000
  - Network:    Add `--host` to expose

â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ LOGS â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
```

You can access the Todo app on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
and, you know, do stuff.

## Ok, so how does that all work?

I'll spare you the details of npm and Svelte, please see the excellent
documentation from those projects to learn more, and will focus on the
TerminusDB stuff.

Using Svelte I created a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) that
implements the specifications of TodoMVC, a project used to compare frontend
frameworks.

The SPA runs in the browser and uses TerminusDB as the backend, as TerminusDB
is a database for the web, no intermedialry backend server is needed, the
frontend can connect directly with the database using RESTful HTTP and the
[TerminusDB JavaScript
SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@terminusdb/terminusdb-client)

### So, how does that initdb bit do its thing?

I will only give a few important examples from the init script here, you can
see the entire script with comments here: [util/initdb.js](util/initdb.js)

First we use the JavaScript SDK to connect to the Database.

``` javascript
const Client = require('@terminusdb/terminusdb-client')
const DB = new Client.WOQLClient('https://127.0.0.1:6363/',
  { user: 'admin', key: 'root' })
DB.organization('admin')
DB.connect()
  .then(() => hasDB())
  .catch(error => console.log('error', error))
```

Once it's connected, we call a function called `hasDB` which creates a database
called `TodoMVC`. 

``` javascript
DB.createDatabase('TodoMVC', {
  label: 'TodoMVC',
  comment: 'DB for TodoMVC backend',
  schema: true
}, 'admin')
  .then(() => hasSchema())
```

When the database has been created the function `hasSchema` is called.

In order to make our code a little more concise, we can set our DB to `TodoMVC`
and create a constant `Q` for `Client.WOQL`, which will help us build queries. 

``` javascript
DB.db('TodoMVC')
const Q = Client.WOQL
```

Now we can use our connected `DB` and our query builder `Q` to create a schema
for the database.

``` javascript
DB.query(Q
  .doctype('Todo')
  .label('Todo')
  .description('Things To Do')
  .property('title', 'xsd:string').cardinality(1)
  .property('completed', 'xsd:boolean').cardinality(1)
).then(response => addExamples())
```

Here we created our schema, which is a `Todo` document type that has two
properties, a `string title` and a `boolean completed`. Both have
a `cardinality` of `1`, which means that each `Todo` can only have 1 of each
property, for example a single `Todo` can not have two titles or zero titles,
but must have one.

Once the `Todo` document type is created, the function `addExamples` is called.

### Triples, Triples, rah rah rah, Triples, Triples, ha ha ha.

``` javascript
DB.query(Q
  .add_triple('doc:todo1', 'type', 'scm:Todo')
  .add_triple('doc:todo1', 'title',
    Q.literal('Taste TerminusDB', 'string'))
  .add_triple('doc:todo1', 'completed',
    Q.literal(true, 'boolean'))
```

So above is how we add an example Todo to the database, by adding triples.

Now, what in tarnation is a triple? Well, in TerminusDB *everything*. It's all
triples. Triples all the way down.

Formally, a triple is a *fact* that includes a *subject*, a *predicate*, and an
*object*.

The *subject* tells us *what thing this fact refers to*, in our case that thing
is a document in our database called `doc:todo1`.

The *predicate* tells us *what this fact tells you about the thing you are
referring to*. So in our case, we have three predicates, `type` tells us what
kind of document `doc:todo1` is, `title` tells is what i's called, and
a `completed` value tells us if it's done or not.

The *object* is *the value that represents what the fact tells us about the
thing that we're referring to*.

So the object 'scm:Todo' is a Todo document type, The object "Taste TerminusDB"
is a string that containing the title, and the object false is a boolean that
means that it is not completed.

This language is handed down to us by the wise creators of RDF and OWL,
standards that TerminusDB uses internally, but those of us who don't care about
these things can think of a triple in a simpler way.

Think of a triple as an object, a property, and a value. So, each triple
assigns a value to a particular property of an object.

Looking at the query above, we add three triples, one that assigns a type to
our Todo, another that assigns a title, and another that assigns the completed value.

So for us to tell the DB to *add a Todo with the title "Taste TerminusDB" that
is not completed*, we add the three triples above.

The `Q.literal` bits are how we cast values. Properties in TerminusDB have
many more possible types of values than JavaScript has.

Thinking in terms of triples is one of the two major differences in how
Terminators think compared to users of relational or document based databases.
The other is unification. That's a real head trip, and we'll cover that in the
next section.

### Ok, we created the DB and an example Todo, but how does the app work?

Once again, I will just cover some important examples, you can find the
complete script here [src/terminusdb.js](src/terminusdb.js)

Also, the JavaScript SDK has convenience functions that allow you to interact
with documents and their properties in a simpler way, often like other graph or
document databases, I will not use these. I'm not trying to be mean or
anything, I just really want you to understand this triple business, oh, and
unification, more on that in a bit.

In the terminusdb.js module we export 6 functions, `state`, `create`, `alter`,
`remove`, `toggle` and `clear`. These functions are used by the Svelte app to read
from and write to the database. I'll explain `state` and `toggle`

The `state` function returns all the `Todo` documents in the database, it works like this.

``` javascript
DB.query(Q 
  .triple('v:Doc', 'type', 'scm:Todo')
  .triple('v:Doc', 'scm:title', 'v:Title')
  .triple('v:Doc', 'scm:completed', 'v:Completed')
).then((response) => {
  callback(null,
    response.bindings.map(item => ({
      id: item.Doc,
      title: item.Title['@value'],
      completed: item.Completed === 'system:unknown'
        ? false
        : item.Completed['@value'] === 'true'
    }))
  )
})
```

Oh, we love triples.

So, we've covered add_triple above when we created our database and added an
example `Todo`, we now we are querying for existing triples, and we are doing
so using, you guessed it, unification.

The *subject* in our triple statements above is always `v:Doc`. This is
a variable.

In our first triple statement we are saying we don't know what this value is.
So, the database will solve for all possible values of this subject that match
the *predicate* and *object*.

The predicate is `type` and the *object* is `scm:Todo`. So the first triple
statement will solve for all triples in the database that have the `type`
`scm:Todo.` Simply, this means that it returns all the `Todos` in the database.

Our SDK uses a *fluent* style, so the query continues with the next triple
statement, which says that for each possible value of `v:Doc` from the previous
statement, find a triple that has the same *subject* and a *predicate* of
`scm:title` (think property called title) and assign to the object (think value
the value of the property) to the variable `v:Title`. 

The next triple statement does the same thing but for the *predicate* `scm:completed`.

So, all told, this is a way of saying find all of our `Todos` and get the title
and completed properties too.

We then take look at tall the results and map them to an array of javascript
objecs with id, title and comepleted as properties. The Todo app uses this
array for it's State.

Unification happened here, but it's subtle, so let's not let it slip by without
comment. Understanding what happened unlocks the power of logic!

So, most of us developers think in terms of inputs and outputs. Functions have
arguments, which are inputs, and return something, which is an output.

Triple statements are not functions, and the three values are not arguments.
You construct a query by chaining statements, you tell the database what you
know, and it returns all possible solutions based on what you know and what is
in the database.

Ok, so before you think I'm wasting your time with profound sounding bullshit, let me give you some more examples that are not used in this app.

Say I know the document Id of a Todo, say `doc:todo1`, but want to know it's
title, this means I know the *subject*, `doc:todo1` and the *predicate*
`scm:title`, but not the *object*, the string which contains the title

So I say this:

``` javascript
triple('doc:todo1', 'scm:title', 'v:Doc')
```

The solution to this statement will bind the string which contains the title to
the variable `v:Doc`

So, the first two "arguments" (they're not arguments), are kind of *like* arguments, and the third "argument" is *like* a return value (it's not a return value).

Now, say we know we have a `Todo` with the title "Taste TerminusDB", but we
don't know the document Id.

Now we say this:

``` javascript
triple('v:Doc', 'scm:title', 'Taste TerminusDB')
```

Now the databases solves this statement such that `v:Doc` contains the
document Id of the Todo with the title 'Taste TerminusDB'

Woah, right?

You might want to jump into the TerminusDB console and try these two queries.
If you haven't yet deleted the `Todo` with the document Id `doc:todo1` and the
`title` "Taste TerminusDB" the queries will work if you just copy and paste
them in. 

It feels like the inputs and outputs just move around.

But wait, it's more complicated than that. These are not inputs and outputs,
they are statements and solutions.

You say what you know and the database finds all possible solutions where your
statement is true.

A few of you are saying, oh, like in Prolog. Well, yeah, like in Prolog, but
let's explain some more.

So a TermunisDB query chains many statements, and the database finds all
solutions where all the statements are true, and as variables are solved for, they
are bound and available to the next statements.

Stay with me here, this is where it really gets trippy.

Let's take a look at another function from `terminusdb.js`, the `toggle`
function. This function data boolean value passed as `data.completed` and sets
all `Todos` that are not completed to the passed value.

This is the query used:

``` javascript
DB.query(Q
  .triple('v:Doc', 'completed', Q.literal(!data.completed, 'boolean'))
  .delete_triple('v:Doc', 'completed', Q.literal(!data.completed, 'boolean'))
  .add_triple('v:Doc', 'completed', Q.literal(data.completed, 'boolean'))
)
```

So, let's say that the `toggle` function was called with data.completed having
a value of true.

The first triple statement solves for all subjects (all `Todos` in our case) in
to database with a predicate `completed` with an object (think value) that is
false (!data.completed), and bind the document id of each of these to the
variable `v:Doc`.

The next statement, delete_triple, receives all the document Ids identified by
the first statement, in this case the ones where completed is false, an deletes
each of them. Remember that one triple is a propery here, so it's not deleting the
`Todo`, just it's `completed` property.

The third statement, an add_triple, now adds the `completed` property back to
our subject, but this time with the value true.

And here we see the next interesting thing about TerminusDB, it's an
append-only database, this is what makes revision control and time-travel
through the data history possible. There is in fact an update_triple
convenience function that you can use to make your code more concise, but it's
just doing more or less the above under the hood.

This is also a demonstration of unification. The value of 'v:Doc' is solved for
all subjects that where completed is false, this value is available for all
subsequent statements. Queries far more powerful than what we need for a Todo
app are possible, but let's leave that for another time.

Mediate on triples and unification. It is the path to Terminatordom.

#### So, I guess this is just hypothetical, you wouldn't really build a Todo app with TerminusDB?

Well, not so fast. I mean, certainly you don't need TerminusDB to make
a TodoMVC example, just dumping objects into the browser's local storage would
do just fine. And it's true that most users of TerminusDB today are using it in
DataOps/MLops scenarios, where data scientists and analysts are involved. It's
roots are very much in being database for data people.

But if you wanted to disrupt the Todo industry with a breakthrough app, then
yeah, you would want to use TermninusDB for your Todo app.

For one, it's schema control keeps your data in good shape, it's RESTful HTTP
API makes it easy to use from any stack, even a frontend web stack.

However, what will really accelerate your development are it's collaboration
features. The ability to clone, fork, branch and merge data, and the fact that
your have revision control means that so much hard stuff becomes easy.

Take for example, adding an undo feature. With a normal database you need to
build your own versioning into your data model, turning rows into journals.
With TerminusDB you have versioning out of the box, you can just revert
a commit and viola, you have undo, and redo, and even proof for your compliance
officer that the data changed in a specific order, and when and by whome all
changes where made.

Now imagine you want to add workflow to your Todo app. Like a Todo gets
assigned by a manager, done by an assignee and confirmed complete by
a different manager.

Once again, with another database this workflow would need to be added to your
data model, you would need to add fields and classes or tables to contain what
workflow stage each todo was in, and if the workflow changed, as it always does
in the real world, sometimes from task task, your data model would also need to
change, this becomes brittle fast.

With TerminusDB you could model your workflow with branches, where assignments
could be added to a manegers branch, merged into an assignees branch, then
merged into a approvers branch, etc. Branches could made for ad-hoc situations
that required a different workflow, and none the less all Todos could
eventually be merged into a common "done" branch, all with no workflow in the
data model itself.

Say you had some clever data scientists that wanted to do some predictive
analytics on your todos, you would need to give them access to your production
database and risk them degrading the performance of your site with their
queries, or even bringing it down with some late night fat fingering. With
TerminusDB and TerminusHub they could just clone or fork their own copy of the
data, merge in new updates whenever they like, and even push back changes if
they somehow enrich the data.

And last but not least, there is the issues I cover in [Continuous Everything as
Code](https://terminusdb.com/blog/2020/05/29/continuous-everything-as-code/), your devs may be changing your schema, and sometimes your data with each
revision of the software that powers your app, and these changes need to go
down your integration and deployment pipeline, yet other databases don't work
will with ci/cd. TerminusDB and TerminusHub make it much easier to clone, fork,
and merge databases to create development, staging and production environments
and push changes between them.

Surely, whether you are building an ML/AI skynet, or a humble productivity app,
content site or e-shop, all these benefits are worth the effort to learn to
think in triples.
